							I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Cyber Security. I am a Junior. Throughout my life in college I have developed paramount skills in computer science such as learning python, html and css, Java, JavaScript,SQL, Bootstrap and am currently learning C with Harvard at ed x. I am passionate about programming and I am willing to learn new concepts all the same. I have enhanced my leadership skills as I am currently the National Society of Black Engineers Senator. I was the president of International Student Association at Claflin University. As a Residential Assistant, I was able to co-ordinate well with my peers and managers in enhancing service delivery to residents of SRC south. Summer Institute of Emerging Managers and Leaders at UC davis California and UC San Diego together with my five credit hours honor's  leadership classes have magnified my  leadership skills. Besides, I have 140 community service hours. I interned with ID Tech summer 2015 and I have a certificate in radiation safety from University of South Carolina as well. That makes me certified in radiation safety in the US. My major goal is to utilize my skills in programming and developing new concepts and ideas with respect to the growing inventions in the computing field.

							<p> <h3>Virginia Tech Hackathon</h3>As a college freshman, this was my first hackathon. I got the opportunity to learn from other college hackers and professionals. I also learnt a lot from mentors at Virginia Tech who inspired me more into the hacking field. I got the opportunity to see inventions being made and be part of it. Apart from learning, I also did community service which made me familiarize with the great minds. In February 2015, we went to the annual program and we developed an app that could connect the barbers to their customers. Customers could be able to locate the nearest barber shop and make an appointment as well. On the other end, the barber could approve the appointment made by the customer or decline the appointment. It was android based version and currently, we are developing IOS based barber app.</p>

							<p> <h3>Rural Source Inc Hackathon</h3>The annual Rural Source Inc hackathon was held at the old medical college of Georgia in Augusta, Georgia. RSI partnered with The Clubhou.se and the City of Augusta to create a college hackathon as a technology component of the Westobou Festival. There were several schools in participation including; Georgia Regents University, University of South Carolina- Aiken, Aiken Technical College, Georgia Southern University, Claflin University , Augusta Technical College and  Paine College were given four hours to compete in the coding competition to develop a custom web application. We managed to create an html and css based website within the required span of time that was compatible with all devices. </p>

							<p><h3> After school program af Felton Labaratory School </h3> 
							As a mentor, I supported the students in meeting essential academic requirements and in helping them envision and take steps toward the career they desired. I combined instructions in professional behavior with affective support. Helping mentees learn new skills and practise new behaviors was also one of my major duties as a mentor. Occasionally I had to advise children who had family issues and took the initiative of reporting to the authorities some cases that deemed serious. 

							<p><h3>After school program at Brookdale Elementary School </h3>
							I volunteered as a tutor and a mentor as well. I assisted children enrolled in kindergarten, through their 3rd grade school year, with reading readiness
							skills. I also enhanced self-esteem and confidence in the child through patience and
							encouragement. I helped children feel successful by giving positive feedback and support.
							Apart from assisting children with homework in ways that extended children's understanding and interest, I also
							supported the literacy learning that happens within the classroom.

							<p><h3>Family fun day</h3>

							Apart from directing visitors and guests towards designated parking lots, I also helped in cleaning the playground and the sidewalks after the function was over. I entertained kids in various games and this also involved story telling.

Apart from that, we also had the sole responsibity of making sure the students work up early and went to bed at the right time. We welcomed students at the begining of every week and mentored them throught the week. This was a great learning experience. I learned patience when dealing with kids and occasionally, I had to make the right decisions whenever students fought or had disagreements. </p>

							<p><h3>University of South Carolina Radiation Safety Summer Internship</h3> I learned radiation safety measures and researched on various causes of radiation, their preventions and made presentations. I cooperated with my peers and supervisors to bring forth a successful summer research. I achieved a comprehensive, well-rounded education and integrated teamwork on several fronts. From the program, I received certification to work in any radiation field across the United States.</p>
